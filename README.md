# SWAT Modeling for the Arizona Tri-University Recharge Project

The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) is a landscape and basin-scale hydrologic model developed by the USDA-ARS, now with a global user community taking advantage of its capabilities in complex water, sediment, and nutrient routing. SWAT, and its fully updated version SWAT+, couple plant growth with runoff, channel, and meteorologic processes. While the model was initially developed as a largely agricultural tool, updates in recent years (including those behind the development of SWAT+) have allowed for improved simulations of mixed use landscapes- including natural environments- and the underlying ecohydrological dynamics.

For the ATUR project, SWAT and SWAT+ are two tools we are using to understand the hydrologic impacts of landscape management strategies, including but not limited to in-stream structures to increase ponding, vegetation thinning and nuisance species removal, and concentration of runoff into high-infiltration areas.
