# SWAT Modeling for the Arizona Tri-University Recharge Project

The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) is a landscape and basin-scale hydrologic model developed by the USDA-ARS, now with a global user community taking advantage of its capabilities in complex water, sediment, and nutrient routing. SWAT, and its fully updated version SWAT+, couple plant growth with runoff, channel, and meteorologic processes. While the model was initially developed as a largely agricultural tool, updates in recent years (including those behind the development of SWAT+) have allowed for more accurate simulations of mixed use landscapes- including natural environments- and the underlying ecohydrological dynamics.

For the ATUR project, SWAT and SWAT+ are two tools we are using to understand the hydrologic impacts of landscape management strategies, including but not limited to in-stream structures to increase ponding, vegetation thinning and nuisance species removal, and concentration of runoff into high-infiltration areas. The model's strengths lay in the representation of streamflow, which is what most model users calibrate and validate their simulations against; for this project, where we are more broadly evaluating management impacts on the partitioning of precipitation, it is essential that we also adequately simulate evapotranspiration and recharge to explicitly resolve how water is distributed.
