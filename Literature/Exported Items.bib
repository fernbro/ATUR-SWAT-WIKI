	abstract = {This research paper addresses the ongoing challenge of developing fine-resolution global digital soil property maps for hydrological modelling applications. Hydrological models are essential for understanding watershed dynamics and the impact of human activities on water resources. Soil data, which plays a crucial role in the hydrological cycle, is a requisite model input. Global digital soil property maps usually have coarse spatial resolutions, adding considerable uncertainty to hydrological models despite calibration efforts. To address this issue, a new global digital soil property map with 250 m spatial resolution, known as Digital Soil Open Land Map (DSOLMap), was developed and evaluated in this study. The DSOLMap has a finer spatial resolution than existing global soil maps and a more detailed soil profile divided into six soil horizons. This new high-resolution global digital soil property map was tailored to the SWAT + model format. SWAT + is the latest released version of the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), one of the most comprehensive hydrological models, and is widely used worldwide. A hydrological evaluation was conducted with the DSOLMap and its results were compared to two other global soil databases using the SWAT + model in a basin located in the north of Spain. The findings showed that using more detailed, finer-resolution soil data, such as those that the DSOLMap offers, improved the hydrological performance of the SWAT + model on a daily scale before and after calibration and validation procedures. The DSOLMap represents a global step forward in hydrological modelling, notably for regions with scarce or unavailable soil information. This new digital soil property map can help decision-makers address global challenges related to water resources and environmental issues through hydrological modelling.},

	abstract = {Simulation of low flow process is critical to water quality, water supply, and aquatic habitat. However, the poor performance of Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) in dry seasons has impeded its application to watersheds characterized largely by low-flows. Aiming at overcoming this shortage, a seasonal calibration scheme was proposed, in which SWAT was calibrated separately for the dry and wet periods and the “optimal” simulation results of these two periods were combined into a complete runoff series. An extended SWAT model incorporating with the proposed seasonal calibration scheme, named SWAT-SC was constructed and compared with the original SWAT to simulate daily runoff in the Jinjiang watershed dominated by a typical subtropical monsoon climate in southeastern China. The study reveals that when Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (ENS) of the original SWAT model indicated a satisfied model performance in a wet season or a whole year, it may not guaranty acceptable performance for the dry period. A significant improvement was achieved by using SWAT-SC for simulating runoffs in the dry period, and although not as notably as the dry period, improvements for runoff simulation of the wet and overall periods were observed as well.},

	abstract = {The assessment of Landuse and Landcover (LULC) changes on hydrology is essential for the development of sustainable water resource strategies. Specifically, understanding how change in each LULC class influences hydrological components will greatly improve predictability of hydrological consequences to LULC changes and thus can help stakeholders make better decisions. However, given the limited availability of digital LULC maps and simultaneous changes of multiple LULC classes, it is difficult to quantify impacts of change in individual LULC class on hydrology. In this study, an integrated approach of hydrological modeling and multiple regression analysis was applied to quantify contributions of changes for individual LULC classes on changes in hydrological components. As a case study, hydrological modeling was conducted for each of the LULC map in four time periods (1973, 1986, 1992, and 1997) in the upper San Pedro watershed using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT). Changes in hydrological components between two simulations using LULC maps in 1997 and 1973, respectively, were related to changes of LULC in a multiple regression to quantify the effect of changes in LULC to that of hydrological components at the subbasinal scale. While urbanization was the strongest contributor to the increase of surface runoff and water yield from 1973 to 1997, replacement of desertscrub/grassland by mesquite was the strongest contributor to the decreased baseflow/percolation and contributed to the increased ET. Increased runoff, declined percolation, and increased ET have a negative impact on water resources in the upper San Pedro River Basin, thus urbanization and mesquite invasion seems to be major environmental stressors affecting local water resources. Our approach in quantifying the contributions of changes for individual LULC to hydrological components will provide quantitative information for stakeholders in planning and making decisions for land and water resource management. The approach to assess changes in surface hydrology could widely be applied to a variety of other watersheds, where time-sequenced digital LULC is available.},

	abstract = {Semiarid ecosystems play a critical role in determining the interannual variability of the global terrestrial carbon sink. Water availability is a critical driver of productivity in semiarid ecosystems, which often alternate between carbon sink/source functioning during wet/dry years. In this study, we investigate how groundwater availability resulting from groundwater-river water exchange influences net ecosystem exchange of CO2 (NEE), evapotranspiration (ET), and the surface energy balance at two semiarid ecosystems along the Columbia River in central Washington, USA. We examined 1 year of eddy covariance measurements from an upland sagebrush ecosystem primarily fed by rainfall without groundwater access and a riparian grassland ecosystem with groundwater access during the dry season due to lateral groundwater-river water exchange. The two sites had distinct seasonal patterns of NEE and ET, driven by differences in water availability. While NEE at the upland sagebrush site was strongly constrained by water availability during the dry months, access to groundwater allowed the riparian site to maintain high NEE magnitude and ET during the same dry months. The riparian site had larger annual gross primary productivity than the upland site (612 vs. 424 gC/m2), which was offset by higher ecosystem respiration (558 vs. 363 gC/m2). Thus, the magnitude of the annual NEE at the upland site was larger than that at the riparian site (−62 vs. −54 gC/m2). Our results demonstrate that groundwater access determined by connectivity between groundwater and surface water can be a critical driver of carbon uptake and ET in semiarid ecosystems.},

	abstract = {Traditional watershed modeling often overlooks the role of vegetation dynamics. There is also little quantitative evidence to suggest that increased physical realism of vegetation dynamics in process-based models improves hydrology and water quality predictions simultaneously. In this study, we applied a modified Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) to quantify the extent of improvements that the assimilation of remotely sensed Leaf Area Index (LAI) would convey to streamflow, soil moisture, and nitrate load simulations across a 16,860 km2 agricultural watershed in the midwestern United States. We modified the SWAT source code to automatically override the model’s built-in semiempirical LAI with spatially distributed and temporally continuous estimates from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). Compared to a “basic” traditional model with limited spatial information, our LAI assimilation model (i) significantly improved daily streamflow simulations during medium-to-low flow conditions, (ii) provided realistic spatial distributions of growing season soil moisture, and (iii) substantially reproduced the long-term observed variability of daily nitrate loads. Further analysis revealed that the overestimation or underestimation of LAI imparted a proportional cascading effect on how the model partitions hydrologic fluxes and nutrient pools. As such, assimilation of MODIS LAI data corrected the model’s LAI overestimation tendency, which led to a proportionally increased rootzone soil moisture and decreased plant nitrogen uptake. With these new findings, our study fills the existing knowledge gap regarding vegetation dynamics in watershed modeling and confirms that assimilation of MODIS LAI data in watershed models can effectively improve both hydrology and water quality predictions.},

	abstract = {A hydrologic model, calibrated using only streamflow data, can produce acceptable streamflow simulation at the watershed outlet yet unrealistic representations of water balance across the landscape. Recent studies have demonstrated the potential of multi-objective calibration using remotely sensed evapotranspiration (ET) and gaged streamflow data to spatially improve the water balance. However, methodological clarity on how to “best” integrate ET data and model parameters in multi-objective model calibration to improve simulations is lacking. To address these limitations, we assessed how a spatially explicit, distributed calibration approach that uses (1) remotely sensed ET data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and (2) frequently overlooked biophysical parameters can improve the overall predictability of two key components of the water balance: streamflow and ET at different locations throughout the watershed. We used the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), previously modified to represent hydrologic transport and filling-spilling of landscape depressions, in a large watershed of the Prairie Pothole Region, United States. We employed a novel stepwise series of calibration experiments to isolate the effects (on streamflow and simulated ET) of integrating biophysical parameters and spatially explicit remotely sensed ET data into model calibration. Results suggest that the inclusion of biophysical parameters involving vegetation dynamics and energy utilization mechanisms tend to increase model accuracy. Furthermore, we found that using a lumped, versus a spatially explicit, approach for integrating ET into model calibration produces a sub-optimal model state with no potential improvement in model performance across large spatial scales. However, when we utilized the same MODIS ET datasets but calibrated each sub-basin in the spatially explicit approach, water yield prediction uncertainty decreased, including a distinct improvement in the temporal and spatial accuracy of simulated ET and streamflow. This further resulted in a more realistic simulation of vegetation growth when compared to MODIS Leaf-Area Index data. These findings afford critical insights into the efficient integration of remotely sensed “big data” into hydrologic modeling and associated watershed management decisions. Our approach can be generalized and potentially replicated using other hydrologic models and remotely sensed data resources – and in different geophysical settings of the globe.},

	abstract = {The main objective of this study was to calibrate and validate the eco-hydrological model Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) with satellite-based actual evapotranspiration (AET) data from the Global Land Evaporation Amsterdam Model (GLEAM\_v3.0a) and from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer Global Evaporation (MOD16) for the Ogun River Basin (20\&thinsp;292\&thinsp;km2) located in southwestern Nigeria. Three potential evapotranspiration (PET) equations (Hargreaves, Priestley–Taylor and Penman–Monteith) were used for the SWAT simulation of AET. The reference simulations were the three AET variables simulated with SWAT before model calibration took place. The sequential uncertainty fitting technique (SUFI-2) was used for the SWAT model sensitivity analysis, calibration, validation and uncertainty analysis. The GLEAM\_v3.0a and MOD16 products were subsequently used to calibrate the three SWAT-simulated AET variables, thereby obtaining six calibrations–validations at a monthly timescale. The model performance for the three SWAT model runs was evaluated for each of the 53 subbasins against the GLEAM\_v3.0a and MOD16 products, which enabled the best model run with the highest-performing satellite-based AET product to be chosen. A verification of the simulated AET variable was carried out by (i) comparing the simulated AET of the calibrated model to GLEAM\_v3.0b AET, which is a product that has different forcing data than the version of GLEAM used for the calibration, and (ii) assessing the long-term average annual and average monthly water balances at the outlet of the watershed. Overall, the SWAT model, composed of the Hargreaves PET equation and calibrated using the GLEAM\_v3.0a data (GS1), performed well for the simulation of AET and provided a good level of confidence for using the SWAT model as a decision support tool. The 95\&thinsp;\% uncertainty of the SWAT-simulated variable bracketed most of the satellite-based AET data in each subbasin. A validation of the simulated soil moisture dynamics for GS1 was carried out using satellite-retrieved soil moisture data, which revealed good agreement. The SWAT model (GS1) also captured the seasonal variability of the water balance components at the outlet of the watershed.

 This study demonstrated the potential to use remotely sensed evapotranspiration data for hydrological model calibration and validation in a sparsely gauged large river basin with reasonable accuracy. The novelty of the study is the use of these freely available satellite-derived AET datasets to effectively calibrate and validate an eco-hydrological model for a data-scarce catchment.},
